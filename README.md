# Data Pipeline with Databricks

## Overview
This README provides my operations and instructions on setting up a data pipeline in Databricks. The small project reads data from a CSV file, performs simple transformations, and writes the result to a Parquet file.

## Requirements
- Databricks account
- Cluster in Databricks
- CSV file for data source

## Steps to Setup the Pipeline
1. **Environment Setup**: Log in to Databricks and ensure your cluster is running.
2. **Create a Notebook**: Create a new notebook in your Databricks workspace.
3. **Data Source**: Use Spark to read data from a CSV file.
    ```python
    data_source = spark.read.csv("/path/to/your/csvfile.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
    ```
4. **Data Processing**: Apply necessary data transformations.
    ```python
    transformed_data = data_source.filter(data_source["column_name"] > 0)
    ```
5. **Data Sink**: Write the transformed data to a Parquet file.
    ```python
    transformed_data.write.parquet("/path/to/output/directory")
    ```
6. **Execution**: Run each cell in the notebook to execute the pipeline.
7. **Documentation**: Prepare a document or video demonstrating the pipeline workflow.

## Additional Notes
- Modify the data source and sink paths as per your setup.
- Adjust the transformation logic based on your specific data processing needs.
